# Clans or Team:
If you create team or timed-team tops BK-Tops will automatically detect and use them.
It will choose the highest priority team or clan plugin that is installed.

### Hook list:
* `BentoBox`
* `BetterTeams`
* `FactionsUUID`
* `KingdomsX`
* `Lands`
* `SimpleClans`
* `SuperiorSkyblock2`
* `Towny`
* `UltimateClans`

:::note
If you need support for any other team or clan plugin, you can request it by 
opening an issue on GitHub or on our Discord.
